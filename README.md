<p>Predict a price for a laptop on popular advertising website <a href="https://lalafo.kg/">lalafo.kg</a>, when price is set to <strong>Negotiable/–î–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—è</strong></p>

<h3>Usage Example</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Find a laptop ad with "Netogiable Price/–î–æ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—è" - <a href="https://lalafo.kg/bishkek/ads/apple-macbook-pro-intel-core-i5-8-gb-ozu-133-id-99023770">sample link</a></li>
  
  <li>We are hosting our model on <a href="https://lalafo-price-predictor.netlify.app/">netlify</a>. Paste the a link and click "Scrape". Our scraping algorithm will follow the link and scrape all the available features.</li>
  <li><p>The "Predict Price" button will run the model and display the approximated price for the chosen laptop advertisement.</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Notice!</strong> In case you would like to run the project, you will have to follow netlify link, click scrape and in web console (<strong>SHIFT + CTRL + "C"</strong>) proceed to the ip address and verify security check. After that there should be no problems.</p>

<h2>Model Building</h2>
<ol>
  <li>To collect the data for training, we wrote a script to scrape features and price for every laptop ad. We collected 3,700 ads.</li>
  <li>After cleaning the data and some feature engineering we had 1.5k instances.</li>
  <li>Since, we had a number of categorical features and due to some other factors we decided to go with <strong>LightGBM</strong>.</li>
  <li>Highest accuracy - 81%</li>
</ol>
